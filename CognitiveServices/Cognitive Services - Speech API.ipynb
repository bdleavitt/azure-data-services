    "    * NEW: Provides neural text-to-speech voices nearly indistinguishable from human speech (English). \n",
    "    * Converts text to natural-sounding speech. \n",
    "    * Offers multiple genders and/or dialects for many supported languages. \n",
    "    * Supports plain text input or Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML).\n",

    "    * Translates streaming audio in near-real-time.\n",
